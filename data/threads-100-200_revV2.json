I      have      cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails      (trying      to act like nothing happened) I m sure her lawyer is telling her to   do      that      so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will      forward      them to you)  I am very upset and I m sure you can understand why, I      really      think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or   she      is      mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?      Anyway,  If I can t meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to   go      over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury      trial?      Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the   something      to      Tonya?  I don t understand....      I can t get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting   for      work      (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after      3:30.

Heather, I think that the three of us (you, Stacey and myself) need to discuss proper procedures regarding Disclosure Labels.Richard    -----Original Message-----From: \tMathis, Heather  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 1:28 PMTo:\tSchwartz, Nicole; Ring, RichardCc:\tBolton, StaceySubject:\tRE: Ohio LabelRichard et al:I m not sure what needs to be done - Nicole says we re doing a physical product in CG&E.

Week <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=ce\" \/>Day 4 - October 18, 2001Afternoon Session=20Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=mpany.=20General Observations=20The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of= all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the= reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20=20FERC DeliverablesA great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =felt was critical. =20The first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panel=ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.The next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varie=d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=nt situation.The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue =a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you= need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=o say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=he need for cautious investigation. =20One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=e \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the que=stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =questions:?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated??         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=edule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=ing from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are a=llowed)?=20?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed??         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=re those contracts?  Are there other solutions??         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=dules), or will they be required at all??         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)??         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=ly unwieldy??         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=reat each NJE as a separate entity?Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will t=ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financi=al hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out= said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don t =believe that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=ion by the Northwest interests was false.NERC and GISBA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a bea=uty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=l short polite jabs at each other s organizations.  Other participants cont=inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and= did not focus on its history.Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were= they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=t, Brownell.Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook s yes-m=an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC s suppos=ed \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =likely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulti=ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments= in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show= the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =talk of folding NERC under GISB\/EISB.The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would= say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.Let me know if you have any questions.Andy RodriquezRegulatory Affairs - Enron

On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20=20FERC DeliverablesA great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =felt was critical. =20The first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panel=ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.The next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varie=d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=nt situation.The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue =a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you= need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=o say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=he need for cautious investigation. =20One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=e \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the que=stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =questions:?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated??         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=edule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=ing from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are a=llowed)?=20?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed??         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=re those contracts?  Are there other solutions??         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=dules), or will they be required at all??         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)??         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=ly unwieldy??         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=reat each NJE as a separate entity?Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will t=ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financi=al hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out= said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don t =believe that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=ion by the Northwest interests was false.NERC and GISBA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a bea=uty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=l short polite jabs at each other s organizations.  Other participants cont=inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and= did not focus on its history.Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were= they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=t, Brownell.Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook s yes-m=an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC s suppos=ed \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =likely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulti=ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments= in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show= the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =talk of folding NERC under GISB\/EISB.The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would= say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.Let me know if you have any questions.Andy RodriquezRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.andy.rodriquez@enron.com713-345-3771=20"},{"messageId":"e9b5a956e1f46be","subject":"FW: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel","sender":"l..nicolay@enron.com","time":"2001-10-22T11:25:54-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"louise.kitchen@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"janet.dietrich@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"david.delainey@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"douglas.smith@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"john.lavorato@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"don.black@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"david.forster@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"david.duran@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"tim.belden@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"f..calger@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"h..foster@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"jae.black@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"c..aucoin@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"dale.furrow@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"jim.meyn@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"claudette.harvey@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"m..presto@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"ben.jacoby@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":"FYI.=20TJ and Claudette--Please forward to your groups.

Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=re those contracts?  Are there other solutions??         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=dules), or will they be required at all??         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)??         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=ly unwieldy??         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?

Although Andy= did not focus on it in his report, there was an individual who sat on the =panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market =postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy.

Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=mpany.=20General Observations=20The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of= all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the= reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20=20FERC DeliverablesA great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =felt was critical. =20The first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panel=ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.The next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varie=d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=nt situation.The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue =a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you= need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=o say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=he need for cautious investigation. =20One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=e \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the que=stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =questions:?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated??         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=edule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=ing from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are a=llowed)?=20?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed??         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=re those contracts?  Are there other solutions??         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=dules), or will they be required at all??         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)??         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=ly unwieldy??         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=reat each NJE as a separate entity?Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will t=ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financi=al hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out= said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don t =believe that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=ion by the Northwest interests was false.NERC and GISBA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=tting organization.

Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.Power Month End Calculation Procedures?\tAt each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.?\tPower curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).?\tRisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day s date.This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.\tChoose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day s interest rate curve.\tChoose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month. << OLE Object: Paintbrush Picture >>"}],"threadId":"e9a6baf761e4f2d","SenderDiversity":0.5555555556,"PaceOfInteractionAvgGap":1407.5,"SenderDiversityEntropy":1.4270610434,"ParticipantGrowth":2.5,"ParticipantSizeVariation":0.8314794193,"Engagement":1.0,"mdsX":-0.4671423769,"mdsY":0.2863883193,"tSNEX":-10.1221437454,"tSNEY":3.579821825},{"messages":[{"messageId":"e9b505f65d1303d","subject":"FW: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance","sender":"chad.landry@enron.com","time":"2001-10-22T08:27:27-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"matthew.lenhart@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"eric.bass@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"stephen.plauche@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":""},{"messageId":"e9b5193121362c6","subject":"FW: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance","sender":"matthew.lenhart@enron.com","time":"2001-10-22T08:48:27-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"mike.grigsby@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":" -----Original Message-----From: \tLandry, Chad  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 10:27 AMTo:\tLenhart, Matthew; Bass, Eric; Plauche, StephenSubject:\tFW: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balancehey plauch, still think it is impossible for this stock to take on a one-handle.  just read below.ckl -----Original Message-----From: \tKiani-Aslani, John  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 8:33 AMTo:\tGonzalez, AndreaSubject:\tTheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance"},{"messageId":"e9b51e45bb99086","subject":"FW: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance","sender":"mike.grigsby@enron.com","time":"2001-10-22T08:54:00-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"matt.motley@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"robert.badeer@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":" -----Original Message-----From: \tLenhart, Matthew  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 10:48 AMTo:\tGrigsby, MikeSubject:\tFW: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance -----Original Message-----From: \tLandry, Chad  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 10:27 AMTo:\tLenhart, Matthew; Bass, Eric; Plauche, StephenSubject:\tFW: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balancehey plauch, still think it is impossible for this stock to take on a one-handle.  just read below.ckl -----Original Message-----From: \tKiani-Aslani, John  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 8:33 AMTo:\tGonzalez, AndreaSubject:\tTheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance"},{"messageId":"e9b5226c55cd4e6","subject":"RE: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance","sender":"matthew.lenhart@enron.com","time":"2001-10-22T08:58:32-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"chad.landry@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":"this is unbelievable.  seems like the worst is yet to come.  if they have to end up issuing more stock this thing can go to $10. -----Original Message-----From: \tLandry, Chad  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 10:27 AMTo:\tLenhart, Matthew; Bass, Eric; Plauche, StephenSubject:\tFW: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balancehey plauch, still think it is impossible for this stock to take on a one-handle.  just read below.ckl -----Original Message-----From: \tKiani-Aslani, John  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 8:33 AMTo:\tGonzalez, AndreaSubject:\tTheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance << File: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance.htm >>"},{"messageId":"e9b5328d4dc78da","subject":"RE: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance","sender":"chad.landry@enron.com","time":"2001-10-22T09:16:09-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"matthew.lenhart@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":""},{"messageId":"e9b53beebe3e666","subject":"RE: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance","sender":"matthew.lenhart@enron.com","time":"2001-10-22T09:26:24-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"chad.landry@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":"i went to grab some pizza, ate and then passed out.  those shot i did with those girls wolly knew put me over the edge.  sorry about taking off like that.  i had a good time, but i ran out of energy quick. -----Original Message-----From: \tLandry, Chad  Sent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 11:16 AMTo:\tLenhart, MatthewSubject:\tRE: TheStreet: Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balancewhat happened to you at CAT\"S?

The picture is making me respond to these diatribes, seeing how my puss is front and center in the photo.  (By the way how many of you old farts from  75 can name the others in the picture?) I get the impression that you all think -kai- is dead among the class of  76.  That is absolute bulls**t!  I still see many of my pledge brothers on a regular basis as well as many of you \"older\" Betas.  (Had dinner with John Miller last night - and he even paid!) My home has always been and will always be open to any Beta who gets his ass to Dallas (except Drow cause he s already here). In fact, the SMU class of  76 is indeed hosting a stunning event for alums this Saturday night at the Highland Park estate (on Beverly Drive) of some SAE that I never heard of (apparently a member of the \"lucky sperm club\")  There will be valet parking and more SAE and Phi Delt alums than you can shake a stick at.  They will be all sitting around with their trophy wifes talking about the size of their Porches and bond portfolios (since they all got out of the stock market 18 months ago).  All this for only 75 bucks.  Hmmm, do I want to go there and enjoy a lovely evening with my fellow classmates, or do I want to walk over one block to Mark Paul s and listen to you whiners that have the wherewithall to make it to Dallas bitch and moan about the  76 pledge class.  Could be a tough decision. If it wasn t for Beek and Elvis last year, I suspect that you members of the  75 class would have been sitting at home watching reruns of Cartoon Carnival (right Arends?). Just remember it was the wisdom and vision of all you whiners that put the guys in that picture together (right C-Paul?)  So quit bitchin and get to Dallas this weekend.  We ll figure out something fun to do! -kai- Benson aka  Mule   (thank-you Bill Jordan for that moniker)   Craig Shackleton wrote: I second the nomination Del - multiple clicks.And I offer in the spirit of  75 a helping hand to the 76 ers to use eWooglin to full advantage.

Of course, I saw only 2 of mypledge brothers (Class of  69).  But, I saw a bunch of the brothers from theclass of  71 (whose 30th Reunion it was - mine was 2 years ago!).  I washoping to meet some of you jackoff idiots who I didn t know.  I thoughtChuck Paul was going to be there, but if he was I didn t get to renew -kai -.Brother Dent, as another Brother Dent, you may not remember but we finallymet a few years ago at the A@M Student Center when you were having a booksigning before the A@M\/ Baylor game and I got you to sign a copy of \"TheJunction Boys\" for my stepson , Jim Bavouset, who was an Aggie Beta.  We hada nice long chat remembering some of the times from back in the 70 s whenyou were the Sports Editor for the Daily Campus and I was working my ass offover in the corner of the campus in law school.  You gave me a businesscard, and I ve been remiss in not contacting you since that serindipitousoccasion when I finallly met you.  I hope that you ll acept this - myapology for not contacting you before now.  I ve actually thought about itseveral times before now.So,  after reading all of these posts from all of you guys from classes justafter mine (and it hurts me that more of my own classmates and guys beforeme haven t found it appropriate to write on this Board), I m quite impressedto see how close all of you guys have remained after all of these years -just like I was to see all of my good friends and Brothers from the class of 71 this past weekend.  I saw a few guys I haven t seen in over 25+ years -and we picked up as if there hadn t been any time that elapsed between.Damn, it s great to be a BETA!The Deacon  69 , #271-kai------ Original Message -----From: \"Felix Zaremba & Co., Inc.\" <azaremba@fzci.net>To: <smu-betas@yahoogroups.com>Sent: Wednesday, October 31, 2001 9:58 AMSubject: Re: [smu-betas] 76ers - it s time to hump it> George Steinwart : Son of a bitch !

At a recent costume party, several pledges (JoeNOT being one of them) decided it would be funny to mock the all blackfraternity on campus by painting their faces black and wearing that frat sletters.  As unbelivable as it seems, that one act set off a chain reactionin Oxford and the General Secy flew down and, in a two sentence statement,ended life for the Betas as they once knew it.  The incident coincided withthe Delta Sig chapter doing something even more stupid at a separate partyon a separate day where pictures showed up on the internet by their partyphotographer of three D Sigs dressed as a black, a KKK clansman and aConfederate soldier, all looking as if they were trying to hang or shoot theblack.  Brilliant huh???  That incident really got the student body in anuproar and then the Beta deal came to light about the same time and bam,goodbye Betas.    I only tell the story here because there have been many news coveragesof both events across the country, making the Betas look like they were wayout of line when, in fact, it was pretty harmless and the black fraternityreally was only tremendously upset with the D Sigs.  Joe, his pledgebrothers, and the actives are in shock at the severity of the decision byOxford and I must admit, so am I.  If any of you out there have any ideas onwhat to do about it, I certainly would welcome them.  Joe was really fallingin love with that chapter and it had a ton of campus leaders in it, muchlike Gamma Omega did once upon a time.  My feeling is that the chapterdeserved some serious and accountable disciplinary punishments and thechapter agreed what they did was stupid and in horrible taste, but toabolish a 34 year old, 120 man chapter for the actions of a few?????

If this was more a political move than anything else, they need to apply to come back in an equal and opposite posture so the national can look good accepting their application.How?  Get the black fraternity on board (quietly at first) showing them this chapter \"was not fairly represented by these stupid acts\", something to that effect.  By on board I mean Beta leaders meet their leaders and convince them to endorse the application to national (A letter from them would be powerful, saying  these guys are real and they are rushing some of our people , I don t know).  The re-charter, then, is a correction of the mistakes and, therefore, the new chapter is clean.As you can tell, I know nothing of the procedures behind a charter and this could take forever, but what alternatives are there if the appeals fell flat?To quote another ass from Little Rock, I feel your pain, as I have Travis, Tyler and Trenton coming along later and I will fight like hell to protect my guys from this type of injustice in any case.Sarl, Hans Hohl, Carl...

And, I hope that none ofthem - though different than yours - offended you.  I was merely trying tothrow in the benefit\/ignorance of my own experiences in such matters.  And,today, while thinking further own the subject, I thought that as part of the\"game plan\" I suggested last night, the chapter might consider involvingsome of its more influential, and credible alums and identify the same typeof alums from the Black fraternity.  Then, when meeting with theall-important intermediary, a suggested meeting between the alums from thetwo frats and the intermediary be made.  I can t decide whether I would wantto suggest including student representatives from the two frats at thisfirst meeting.  I seem to come down on the play of having a second meetingwith the alums from both frats with the intermediary and include selectedstudent representatives (non-hotheads from our side) to attend and take anactive role in the negotiations.  From there, if all goes well - a BIG\"if\" - the same groups can then have a big meeting with all members andpledges from both frats (maybe dangerous) or have separate meetings witheach frat (less volatile) where the enemy representatives attend along withthe intermediary.- kai -Dick Dent #267----- Original Message -----From: \"CARL HOHL\" <handshohl@eudoramail.com>To: <smu-betas@yahoogroups.com>Sent: Thursday, November 15, 2001 9:55 AMSubject: Re: [smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas> alDentiii, JaDrow:>> I applaud your additions and input!

It s not MY kind of thinking that lead anywhere.  It s stupidpledges with insufficient guidance from the leaders of the Auburn chapterthat lead to this discussion.  The Leaders of the Beta chapter should havesent those guys packing immediately for their un-funny dress up.  Butremember when Ted Danson dressed in blackface when he was dating WhoopiGoldberg?   The glitterati considered it poor taste and then dropped thewhole issue almost immediately.  I can t claim to know the Greek diversitystatistics at Auburn, so I don t pre-suppose that the Black Fraternity hasno whites, nor that the other national fraternities have no blacks.  I doknow that  campus life has changed considerably in 30 years, thatinter-racial dating and marriages are quite prevalent and the student bodiesand their organizations (including Greek) are reflective of those changes.The point still remains that the Black Fraternity is as racial isolated, orperhaps even more racially isolated, than probably any other campusorganization.

So I decided Ineeded apassionate girl with a zest for life.In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everythingwas an emergency;she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.So I decided I needed a girl with stability.When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She wastotallypredictable andnever got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that Ineeded a girl with someexcitement.When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn t keep up with her.Sherushed from onething to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous thingsand made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially andvery energetic, but directionless.So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet plantedfirmly on theground and married her.She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.*******************Internet Email Confidentiality Footer*******************Privileged\/Confidential Information may be contained in this message.

Please correc=t me if I am wrong here, Tim.3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo=w (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total =Capex).4) The Withdrawn Partners  historical contributions ($228 million) will be =added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee= of $40 million should be included in the project budget.5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (1=4.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but= some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pac=k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l=east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 year=s.6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assumin=g 30\/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdo=wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin=g, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financ=ial close date and commercial agreement\/preliminary determination date to c=alculate AFUDC more accurately.7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with ba=lloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will= be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will b=e unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches= with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc.=208) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t=he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of ope=rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currenc=y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during con=struction period should be added.=20Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS c=urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excludi=ng IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la=rger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan s email. =20Thanks,=20JB=20Jebong Lee=20713-853-9722 office=20713-306-8658 cell"},{"messageId":"ea4b7b9b07a044d","subject":"Re: Fw: RE: Toll Model Review Meeting Updates","sender":"danny.mccarty@enron.com","time":"2001-11-20T12:38:59-08:00","recipients":[{"email":"rod.hayslett@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":"Rod,    The view now is to minimize costs and move toward a sale of our A to B rights as a withdrawn partner to WMB or TCPL, or we may negotiate a deal that would allow us a back in intertest if we pay a promote at a given point in the future.

He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.

Rod Smith <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11\/20\/01Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday s game against the Cowboys. \"We ll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,\" Shanahan told the Denver Post. \"If he can help our football team, he ll play. If he s in a situation where he can t perform at the level that we think! c! an help our team, then we ll keep him out and put somebody else in.\" Benjamin Gay <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won t indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. \"We ll try to get him involved in some of the games,\" Davis said. \"We ll see.\" Kevin Lockett <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. Tony Banks <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday s game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn t been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the  Skins. Jacquez Green <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01Green (abdomen) is! e! xpected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He s been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable. Terrell Owens <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11\/20\/01Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend s game against Carolina. The injuries aren t considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis. Cecil Martin <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=133349&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday s game against Dallas. He ll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend s game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. Giants <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=19&>, DT NYG - Matty Updated 11\/20\/01According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn s surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he d be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. Elvis Grbac <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=play! er! s&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team s starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.Donald Driver <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=133276&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday s game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. Ravens <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=3&>, DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11\/20\/01Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual. Cowboys <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He ll help keep Denver s running game in check, but don t expect his presence to give Dallas  defense added Fantasy value as a whole. Emmitt Smith <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&r! an! dom=4658&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass\/Hull Updated 11\/20\/01Smith (knee) will start on Thursday s game against Denver. \"I m not 100 percent, but I m healthy enough to do my job,\" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He ll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas  horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. Donald Hayes <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11\/20\/01Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday s game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he s expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.! Terry Hardy <http:\/\/football222.fantasy.sportsline.com\/mp\/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.

He is not expected to return for =another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a k=ey performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Dou=g Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11\/20\/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego U=nion-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flut! ie! and rookie Drew= Brees. \"Doug is going to be our quarterback,\" he said. \"You can talk about= controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is ou=r quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week.\" S=till, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  M=ark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 Bruener will miss the re=st of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely a=ffect Jerome Bettis  statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the =best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - G! ig!= gles Updated 11\/20\/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer= being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinn=ey , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week =after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this= week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11\/20\/01 Wycheck (calf) will= be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Ste=ve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 The Tennessean says McNair= s hand was sore when he arrived at the team s practice facility on Monday.= Jeff Fisher now says he doesn t expect him to miss any practice time this =week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11\/20\/01 Alexander (rib=s) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marv=in Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11\/20\/01  Minnis (ankle) is list=ed as doubtful for Sunday s game. Larry Parker may have to start in his pla=ce,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11\/20\/01 Brunell (quadriceps) =might miss Sunday s game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again= if Brunell can t play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11\/20\/01 B=runell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday s game against Baltimore. Jonathan Qu=inn will start again if Brunell can t play.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free A=gent Updated 11\/20\/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful f=or Sunday s game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in= his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11\/20\/01 Pathon (foot) i=s done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (kne=e) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back in=to the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler  , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11\/20\/01 Dav=e Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fi=elder and backup Ray right now. ``That s kind of hypothetical,   he said. `=`Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we re going to get it squared a=way and play turnover-free football.    Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated =11\/20\/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be suffi=ciently healed to play in Thursday s game against the Cowboys. \"We ll get a= chance to evaluate that during the week and see,\" Shanahan told the Denver= Post. \"If he can help our football team, he ll play. If he s in a situatio=n where he can t perform at the level that we think! c! an help our team, t=hen we ll keep him out and put somebody else in.\"   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE -= Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis wo=n t indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. \"We ll try to get h=im involved in some of the games,\" Davis said. \"We ll see.\"   Kevin Lockett= , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury =last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia=. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this =point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 Barring any setb=acks, Banks will start Sunday s game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffe=red a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn t been feeling any after eff=ects of the injury and should be under center for the  Skins.   Jacquez Gre=en , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 Green (abdomen) is! e! xpected to =return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He s been inconsistent th=is season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens =, WR SF - Martin Updated 11\/20\/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and a=nkle during the overtime session of last weekend s game against Carolina. T=he injuries aren t considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be= in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - F=ree Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday= s game against Dallas. He ll miss a few days of practice, but is expected =to play in this weekend s game against Washington. Martin has no real value= as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Updated 11\/2=0\/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn s surgically-r=epaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fa=ct, the team was unsure that he d be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cri=s Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on =a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the= rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 T=he Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as= the team s starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start f=or most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01= Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thurs=day s game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fant=asy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11\/20\/01= Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after under=going knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Ba=ltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than =usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 Linebacker Dexter =Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will li=kely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He ll hel=p keep Denver s running game in check, but don t expect his presence to giv=e Dallas  defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL -= Bass\/Hull Updated 11\/20\/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday s game agai=nst Denver. \"I m not 100 percent, but I m healthy enough to do my job,\" Smi=th told the Dallas Morning Star. He ll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbe=rs due to Dallas  horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all pos=sible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11\/20\/01 Hayes suffered b=ruised ribs during Sunday s game against San Francisco. He may miss some pr=actice time this week, but he s expected to play this weekend against Atlan=ta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could= turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.!   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free= Agent Updated 11\/20\/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week a=fter missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain= to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent= Updated 11\/20\/01 Harris is out for Thursday s game against Denver due to a= hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only= worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright =2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Jeff Dasovich met with SCE to discuss settlement of  Enron s PX claims.  Nothing was agreed to, but I wanted to make certain you were aware of this meeting.  It is interesting that all of SCE s comments dealt with their under collection and the DWR costs.  I have not continued to monitor current tariff assumptions.  However, I do not believe estimates for the resolution of these issues are currently included.   As I understand things, it remains anybody s guess as to what will be required of direct access customers, much less how much of the under collection SCE will be allowed to recover.  Regulatory Affairs is working closely with the desk to completely understand the impact of future regulatory decisions and work to obtain the best result for Enron.  I will make sure you and Mary Lynne stay informed re these discussions.   If you would like to discuss, just call.

That heifer called to tell me thatJordan was telling her that I had given him money to buy a Fruitopia softdrink (first of all, it took me questioning her three times to find outwhat the heck Fruitopia meant)  and she wanted to check with me to see ifthat were true, because she didn t allow that particular drink in her classbecause it had too much sugar in it......well, I was pissed number one,that you would even call and upset me at work by asking me such a dumb assquestion.  You are the adult here, not Jordan!  She also said Jordan kindof smarted off to her.....well, take control sister.....you obviously haveno control if you have to call me on my job to settle an insignificantmatter such as this.

It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really   could   have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I   had a date with my mother-in-law.  She s a member of a book club and   they   had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was   nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at   6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating   at   6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl,   Ms   Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my   semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite   stores, Chico s, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor   length (not by design, I m just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top   that   I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I   wore   my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I   wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo  flashy and my black high   heel   sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.   When   I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said   \"Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the   husband, didn t say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take   some   pictures of me, so we ll see how those come out (smile).   We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd   said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really   entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!   Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I   was   wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that   she s   back in school, so that s why she s hasn t been there.   How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we ll   get   a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn t going to be home   until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power   Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I m ready for a change   too.   Right now, it doesn t seem like me and the boys would be missing much.   All   we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,   independent, activities.  Plus, I m ready for a new house, clean break   and   new environment.   Oh well, talk with you later!

I ve prayed and given it to God, but   she      still struggles.  We re seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The      4th      grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up   in      prayer.  She s pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that   she s      dumb      and that she ll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a   letter      last      night telling me to stop telling her that she s smart, because she s      not.      She said that she s dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt   me      so      bad.      Lil  Steve s report card was excellent.  He s doing a great job.  The      best      thing we could ve done for him was put him at Southwest.

I said, \"Whatever, you ve just confirmed what I feel so   just   go on & get out of here.\"  He s so-oo stupid!  I m his wife and can t   ask   where he s been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really   don t have time for his mess.   So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really   could   have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I   had a date with my mother-in-law.  She s a member of a book club and   they   had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was   nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at   6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating   at   6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl,   Ms   Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my   semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite   stores, Chico s, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor   length (not by design, I m just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top   that   I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I   wore   my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I   wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo  flashy and my black high   heel   sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.   When   I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said   \"Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the   husband, didn t say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take   some   pictures of me, so we ll see how those come out (smile).   We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd   said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really   entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!   Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I   was   wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that   she s   back in school, so that s why she s hasn t been there.   How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we ll   get   a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn t going to be home   until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power   Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I m ready for a change   too.   Right now, it doesn t seem like me and the boys would be missing much.   All   we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,   independent, activities.  Plus, I m ready for a new house, clean break   and   new environment.   Oh well, talk with you later!

Keep her lifted up   in      prayer.  She s pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that   she s      dumb      and that she ll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a   letter      last      night telling me to stop telling her that she s smart, because she s      not.      She said that she s dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt   me      so      bad.      Lil  Steve s report card was excellent.  He s doing a great job.  The      best      thing we could ve done for him was put him at Southwest.

Siera s doing much better in math, but she s had a few, low language   grades.  She s only been tutored once.

Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you   weren t      in      Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn t it   make      you      feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy      feeling brought on by your child.  I can t wait to see the pictures.      I m sorry to hear that you re having plumbing problems.  Did Todd   call a      plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?      I m looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on   Sunday?      I      was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang      with      the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher      Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what      all      the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?      After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve s cousin was   giving      a      small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn t want to go, but      Steve      asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how   much      he      loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He      also      apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to   Siera      for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn t like the way   he      treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her   for      speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I   felt      like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know      what.      He wasn t getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to      snuggle      up under me.

Others areeither still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not issuea statement.  Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertiblebonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred. Whatis in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of \"NotContingent\" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic typicallyrequired of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires that thepayment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to acontingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at theoption of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option ofthe trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to exercisethe conversion (sometimes referred to as a \"widows and orphans\" clause) is astandard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protectbondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversionright when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so. Inthe case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economicallybeneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the trusteeto convert exists. A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the CreditDerivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for yourreview. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form, theUser s Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published in thenext week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by the\"group of six\" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents, wesuggest that \"plain vanilla\" convertible bonds should satisfy the \"NotContingent\" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable. \"Plainvanilla\" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversionis at the option of the holder of the trustee. A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA meeting) isscheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything priorto that meeting. I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statementregarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their viewson whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are alsodiscussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters how wemight achieve a legal basis for making the statement.

To that end EEL has rolled out a voluntary redundancy program.  Following suit, Metals NA is also rolling out a Voluntary Separation Program to all staff in the US and we want to include those employees in Montreal.I ve been working with Michelle Cash to finalise the plan, attached are two documents that will give you a summary of the plan.  In essence, its 2 wks base pay per year of service PLUS 2 wks base pay per 10K of salary for an executed Waiver and Release.Do you see any issues with making the Montreal staff eligible for this plan?A general employee meeting is being held tomorrow to announce the roll out and Monday will be the 2 wk kick of the program when employees will receive more detail of the plan.Practically speaking, we anticipate keeping only 2-3 people in Montreal.Let me know what you think.ThanksCathy << File: Summary Description.doc >>  << File: BU Briefing to Staff.doc >> Human ResourcesEnron Metals & Commodity Corp.520 Madison Ave., 28th FloorNew York, NY 10022Tel: 212-715-5276Fax: 212-715-5231E-Mail: Catherine.Huynh@Enron.com <mailto:Catherine.Huynh@Enron.com>"},{"messageId":"e9a0da384bc3aa1","subject":"Re: Enron Metals North America Voluntary Separation","sender":"fmackin@aol.com","time":"2001-10-18T10:27:16-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"lizzette.palmer@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"michelle.cash@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":"Lizzette and Michelle, Attached is a discussion draft of the plan document.

One of my concerns is, if we notify someone that we accept their Voluntary application, but need them to work for the next 3-4 months, the employees  motivation level might be very low which will effect their performance level.  Or perhaps we can build a statement in to the Separation and Release Agreement stating that the completion of their transition of their role needs to be satisfactorily completed to receive the separation pay.Also, somewhat related, do we expect to have the involuntary severance plan amended anytime this year?  As I m working out the next stage of involuntary severance reductions, just need to know if the calculation is likely to change.Thanks Michelle.CathyHuman ResourcesEnron Metals & Commodity Corp.520 Madison Ave., 28th FloorNew York, NY 10022Tel: 212-715-5276Fax: 212-715-5231E-Mail: Catherine.Huynh@Enron.com -----Original Message-----From: \tCash, Michelle  Sent:\tThursday, October 18, 2001 1:57 PMTo:\tHuynh, CatherineSubject:\tFW: Enron Metals North America Voluntary SeparationFYI, please let me know if you have any comments.

I believe we can make the statement in 2.3.  Basically, it s saying that an employee won t get benefits unless willing to sign a release that the company agree is fine.  However, even with this language, other external obligations will still apply to the company --e.g., the obligation to not offer contracts on a discriminatory basis. 2.    You are right on 56 weeks.  I caught that as well and have changed. 3.    I believe we could reduce the period, unless Pat thinks otherwise.  What period would you like?  Also, we could use oral notice if you like; however, I think written notice is better because there is a clear, objective indicator of when notice was provided from which to measure the time period.    I think the better approach on performance is include a statement about it in the faq s and spd documents, and shorten the notice period under 5.2(iv) (i.e., poor performance for x days is grounds for termination for cause and for denial of the severance benefits.) 4.    Involuntary reduction plan.  I don t know the answer to this, but Michelle may. I have prepared a redlined version of the plan with my proposed changes. Cathy, I will incorporate your changes as well and forward the draft plan along with the FAQ s document, which now incorporates the benefits language. --Lizzette I agree with Lizzette s comments. Regarding item 3 and the remedial period to improve performance, the time period is a design decision.  There is no requirement for any remedial period, but by design, the employees will be more likely to accept the design without objecting to fairness if there is a reasonable remedial period.  The design theory is not to create a distraction that reduces productivity or creates distracting labor relations. I am not sure what the issue is about the amendment question.  There may be other employers who establish a separate voluntary severance program with different terms and provisions than the design incorporated into the Enron Metals program.  If this might become an Enron wide multiple employer issue, should it be addressed now at the Enron Corp. level?

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity\/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf\/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent s Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\" Regent President John Ehrman said, \"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\" The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent s core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease."},{"messageId":"e9b4d6624050cc0","subject":"RE: New Mexico Power Plant Project","sender":"tk.lohman@enron.com","time":"2001-10-22T07:35:29-07:00","recipients":[{"email":"kimberly.watson@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":"Supplies have not been lined up as of yet.

This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don t already have them in place.Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.

I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and\/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.

The most viable and quickest way to get the cash we felt was to increase the revolver from $35 MM to $70 MM because, as stated below, there exists significant current capital needs to fill the Enron #1 storage cavern.  However, even still, this would only ensure a cash distribution at the end of December - the normal schedule for the partnership.There may be one more possiblity.  We could reapproach the board about the prior structure of levering up Bridgeline in order to extract cash from the joint venture - it failed last year because Texaco did not want the cash.  It may different now that Chevron is involved, but I doubt it.  My guess is that senior management (i.e. Louise) would have to put pressure on the appropriate channels.  I would rather pay a \"premium\" to Chevron\/Texaco for levering Bridgeline than entering in a series of park-and-lend arrangements because we could get more cash up front. In addition, any park-and-lend arrangements could have negative earnings impacts contingent upon the shape of the NYMEX.Regards,Jean -----Original Message-----From: \tRedmond, Brian  Sent:\tFriday, October 26, 2001 9:44 AMTo:\tKitchen, Louise; Hodges, GeorganneCc:\tColwell, Wes; Mrha, Jean; Washington, DeannaSubject:\tRE: Bridgeline Cash and ARTo all:As of today, Bridgeline has $14MM of cash and expects to get $15MM from the payment of Oct receivables by the end of the month.

The majority of TW s business is the West market.  The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be combined.Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct marketsThanks!

It was first raised by AGA and a few LDCs (Brooklyn Union, in particular) in a rehearing request on one of the proceedings where a pipeline was filing compliance with Order 587 (the order requiring compliance with GISB).  GISB moved the issue into one of the committees, and the LDCs and a few marketers have been fighting over it ever since.  I understand that some pipelines side with the LDCs and some of them don t feel strongly about it one way or the other.  Ultimately, GISB reported to FERC that they weren t able to resolve the issue due to the conflicting viewpoints of the various segments.  Thus, the NOPR.Input from the traders is that they don t have objections to Partial Day Recalls as long as we know the capacity is released with that right reserved, so we can value our bids accordingly.  Leslie is going to write a short pleading to emphasize this position and point out that releasing shippers should be able to specify whether or not they intended to make the release subject to partial day recalls.  It shouldn t be a big deal, because they now have to specify whether or not they are subject to the current recall provisions.  It was not spelled out in the NOPR.  We will talk to Joe, but I ve been told the Enron pipelines are not too concerned about it.By the way, I had to join Brian Redmond for a conference call yesterday at 2:30, so I couldn t join the EPSA call.  It sounds like they haven t decided whether to file or not. -----Original Message-----From: \tSteffes, James D.

This would be a possibility only for LDCs. Comments should be submmitted around Nov 19. It was considered disruptive for the market. Discos argue they need this possibility in order to increase reliability. The problem is that the release capacity would be less attractive if distcos are given this possibility (the value of release capacity would be lower than IT). It was mentioned that this could lead to the use of daily balancing. The main fear is that State Commissions could order Discos to keep the recall right in their release.They plan to talk to INGAA about this issue and said they would appreciate any feedback to talk to INGAA.On other issue, it was mentioned the due date for comments about the Affiliate transaction NOPR was moved to Dec. 20.The next conference call will be December 4 (Tuesday) at 3:30 pm.

One person said she wished we would stop getting t=hese emails because they are \"empty.\" All we are getting are generalities a=nd hollow comments about yesterdays news.

I want to see leadership. Where is Ken and t=he Board? Mayor Guiliani got out in the public after the World Trade Center= disaster and reassured the public. He became a leader. He didn t sit in hi=s office and have a ghost writer send empty emails to city employees.=20I watched as Rite Aid went through something similar to what Enron is going= through. Enron would be well served to study the Rite Aid situation and le=arn from their experience. Rite Aid stumbled along for 6 months while the B=oard and CEO defended their actions and were not able to face reality until= the company stock fell from $50 to $3. You need to make dramatic changes i=n the management structure or else management needs to step out and publicl=y restore confidence. It does NO GOOD for the Board and Ken to stand behind= management and business groups only to turn around and put individuals \"on= leave\" or close those business groups you stood behind a day earlier.=20I noticed how little confidence the top executives at Enron had in this com=pany when they sold off hundreds of millions of dollars in stock between No=vember and February. Many of us see that as the beginning of the moral bank=ruptcy at the top of Enron. We put our retirement in your hands and you pil=fered it. I had so much faith in Enron s management that I have taken my an=nual bonus in stock options. To me that is a duty to demonstrate my commitm=ent to Enron. Rumors are circulating in the Portland office that the Board =is not likely to fund a bonus pool this year. Now that is inspiration! Is t=hat true?=20You MUST instill confidence in your employees TODAY. You claim that Enron e=mployees are your most valuable assets. You had better treat them as such. =Email such as this one DO NOT INSPIRE confidence. This is not Enron s proud=est moment. I enjoy working for the company. I take pride in my work and do= my job honestly and open. The deals I bring in to this company are done in= the spirit of mutual benefits with our counter parties. I was disappointed= to get a copy of a PR piece in my home mail yesterday with interviews and =profiles of \"Three Men.\"  Reading their values and accomplishments led me t=o believe these guys are motivated not by family and ethics but rather by m=aterial possession.

We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.  These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.

An= announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o=ut this week,  per Mark Patterson.The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actua=l energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from =a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the p=rotocols.  So the OOMC\/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services= with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the s=pirit of the OOM s, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.  =20Here is the problem:the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols= to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot disp=atchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were= not generating into the grid.We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC mea=ns run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME =for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Er=cot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to r=un by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal=c, as we were previously under OOMC orders.I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=is issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=cot s  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at= their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=c,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=d receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark= also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=ne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me \"dont worry,=  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=st money.\"Here is my view:OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.Ercot s interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =a group supposedly unconcerned with price.If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=ME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =imbalance.OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=ement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=pes of filing for a \"breakeven.\"   Ridiculous.I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had \"no comment=\" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has \"no comme=nt.\"Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=sure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same= path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will =receive.I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in respons=e to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  E=rcot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online =to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their vie=w was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an =Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compli=ance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME de=ployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a softwar=e issue, not a protocol issue.  =20We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett=led.  Once we have been OOMC d,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full= load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down =the unit.    Ercot said that \" it was entirely reasonable that we would  re=quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME.\"The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in=struction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr=uction on a regular basis?Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via= OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic en=vironment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations pers=onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for \"forcing them to= OOME our plant.\"Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?

Th=e OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs u=nder Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensa=tion has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for =OOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Ra=te value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOM=C\/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus runn=ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the =marketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is locat=ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS=E to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas=. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh=ould be Reliability Must Run (\"RMR\") and be paid at an adequate premium for= their support of the system  reliability.I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over =the interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, =and we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinit=iating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom=orrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus =we are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with a=n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): \"thr=eat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise= is not in compliance with these Protocols\".  Though the Protocols Sections= 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service pr=oducts that it is  generating capacity available but not energy delivered t=o the grid , I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Gui=des  definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Secti=on 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinc=tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi=on stated by John Forney below.=20Sorry for the long e-mail -- I was trying to provide a statting point for y=our group.  -----Original Message-----From: =09Forney, John M. =20Sent:=09Wednesday, November 14, 2001 12:27 PMTo:=09Portz, David; Gilbert-smith, DougSubject:=09Ercot QuestionsDavid,I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, s=tarting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi=ds exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium =is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formu=la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is =zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An= announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o=ut this week,  per Mark Patterson.The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actua=l energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from =a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the p=rotocols.  So the OOMC\/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services= with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the s=pirit of the OOM s, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.  =20Here is the problem:the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols= to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot disp=atchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were= not generating into the grid.We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC mea=ns run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME =for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Er=cot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to r=un by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal=c, as we were previously under OOMC orders.I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=is issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=cot s  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at= their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=c,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=d receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark= also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=ne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me \"dont worry,=  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=st money.\"Here is my view:OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.Ercot s interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =a group supposedly unconcerned with price.If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=ME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =imbalance.OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=ement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=pes of filing for a \"breakeven.\"   Ridiculous.I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had \"no comment=\" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has \"no comme=nt.\"Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=sure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same= path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will =receive.I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in respons=e to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  E=rcot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online =to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their vie=w was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an =Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compli=ance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME de=ployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a softwar=e issue, not a protocol issue.  =20We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett=led.  Once we have been OOMC d,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full= load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down =the unit.    Ercot said that \" it was entirely reasonable that we would  re=quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME.\"The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in=struction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr=uction on a regular basis?Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via= OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic en=vironment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations pers=onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for \"forcing them to= OOME our plant.\"Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me, = what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.Thanks,JForney37160"},{"messageId":"ea3616336d0a557","subject":"RE: ASAP please: ERCOT Questions OOMC & OOME","sender":"david.portz@enron.com","time":"2001-11-16T08:56:12-08:00","recipients":[{"email":"thane.twiggs@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"jean.ryall@enron.com","type":"CC"},{"email":"m..forney@enron.com","type":"CC"},{"email":"l..nicolay@enron.com","type":"CC"},{"email":"doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com","type":"CC"},{"email":"jean.ryall@enron.com","type":"BCC"},{"email":"m..forney@enron.com","type":"BCC"},{"email":"l..nicolay@enron.com","type":"BCC"},{"email":"doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com","type":"BCC"}],"body":"Thane -- I think word back from you is the next step needed in this process=.

I think that this is the s=pirit of the OOM s, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.  =20Here is the problem:the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols= to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot disp=atchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were= not generating into the grid.We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC mea=ns run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME =for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Er=cot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to r=un by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal=c, as we were previously under OOMC orders.I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=is issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=cot s  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at= their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=c,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=d receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark= also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=ne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me \"dont worry,=  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=st money.\"Here is my view:OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.Ercot s interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =a group supposedly unconcerned with price.If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=ME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =imbalance.OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=ement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=pes of filing for a \"breakeven.\"   Ridiculous.I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had \"no comment=\" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has \"no comme=nt.\"Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=sure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same= path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will =receive.I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in respons=e to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  E=rcot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online =to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their vie=w was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an =Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compli=ance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME de=ployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a softwar=e issue, not a protocol issue.  =20We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett=led.  Once we have been OOMC d,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full= load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down =the unit.    Ercot said that \" it was entirely reasonable that we would  re=quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME.\"The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in=struction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr=uction on a regular basis?Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via= OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic en=vironment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations pers=onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for \"forcing them to= OOME our plant.\"Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me, = what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.Thanks,JForney37160"}],"threadId":"ea308696a300936","SenderDiversity":0.375,"PaceOfInteractionAvgGap":171.0,"SenderDiversityEntropy":1.0397207708,"ParticipantGrowth":0.625,"ParticipantSizeVariation":5.4543560573,"Engagement":0.3,"mdsX":0.2255617034,"mdsY":-0.0649930189,"tSNEX":-5.2284903526,"tSNEY":-0.3620428443},{"messages":[{"messageId":"ea21f5eac7b1615","subject":"FW: Happy Birthday Don Jr.","sender":"don.baughman@enron.com","time":"2001-11-12T11:08:32-08:00","recipients":[{"email":".bat@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".bob@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".david@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".gerald@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".jay@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".joe@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".lalena@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".marc@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".mark@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".matt@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".mike@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".patty@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".randy@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".reid@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".richard@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".robert@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".scott@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".scott@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".wayne@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":".kenneth@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"dean.laurent@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"l..garcia@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"rudy.acevedo@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"joe.stepenovitch@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"matt.lorenz@enron.com","type":"TO"},{"email":"f..campbell@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":"Dear Friends and FamilyCome Join the Fun!Don Baughman Jr. Will be 31!Sunday November 18, 2001 3:00 P.M.Baughman Home- Iowa ColonyBar -B-Q by TravisGiven by: Mom, Dad,Travis,Andrea, Troy, and ShelbyRSVP: 281-431-2987See Ya ll Soon!"},{"messageId":"ea22013a007483d","subject":"RE: Happy Birthday Don Jr.","sender":"matt_doggett@dell.com","time":"2001-11-12T11:20:53-08:00","recipients":[{"email":"don.baughman@enron.com","type":"TO"}],"body":"When do you get your Dynegy badge for the front door?How have you been?How is your woman?Matt DoggettDell Sales ManagerEmail: matt_doggett@dell.comPhone: 800 901 3355 x 66311 -----Original Message-----From: \tBaughman Jr., Don [mailto:Don.Baughman@enron.com]Sent:\tMonday, November 12, 2001 1:09 PMTo:\tBat Oggero (E-mail); Bob Poston (E-mail); David Nobles (E-mail);Gerald Snapka (E-mail); Jay Purdom (E-mail); Joe Kuehler (E-mail); LalenaStavinoha (E-mail); Marc Stewart (E-mail); Mark Doggett (E-mail); MattDoggett (E-mail); Mike Newman (E-mail); Patty Polensky (E-mail); RandyDoggett (E-mail); Reid Stavinoha (E-mail); Richard Hrabal (E-mail); RobertPearson (E-mail); Scott Smith (E-mail); Scott Tichavsky (E-mail); WayneHerndon (E-mail); Kenneth Schall (E-mail); Laurent, Dean; Garcia, Miguel L.;Acevedo, Rudy; Stepenovitch, Joe; Lorenz, Matt; Campbell, Larry F.Subject:\tFW: Happy Birthday Don Jr.> Dear Friends and Family>> Come Join the Fun!>> Don Baughman Jr. Will be 31!>> Sunday November 18, 2001 3:00 P.M.>> Baughman Home- Iowa Colony>> Bar -B-Q by Travis>> Given by: Mom, Dad,Travis,Andrea, Troy, and Shelby>> RSVP: 281-431-2987>> See Ya ll Soon!>>**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and\/or its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient (s).

The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who =sign a \"suitable\" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs read as follow=:1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct acc=ess contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direc=t access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001, shal=l submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreeme=nts along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A failure =to submit this information for the Commission s consideration will be consi=dered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts a=nd agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of the actual =contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commission s Doc=ket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert Barnett.2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have e=xecuted direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protect=ive order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which shall be =submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3. =203.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w=ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order= and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission =staff by December 11, 2001.=204.     Parties  supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons=e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja=nuary 4, 2002.As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name=s, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and WPTF= are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they= wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this= Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering our =options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very prelimina=ry analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction o=ver either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is also particula=rly outrageous because of the statements that, \"A failure to submit this in=formation for the Commission s consideration will be considered a waiver of= the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements=\" and \"Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and ag=reements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreement=s are in effect.\"  The former is a likely denial of due process and the lat=ter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitor=s and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-depend=ent customers. =20=20Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is t=ime for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC, SPU=RR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the Gove=rnor s Office on down, including in the media.

I m having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will haveany choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offerup any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair toattempt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their dueprocess rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl.

The contracts will be available to ALL otherparties who sign a \"suitable\" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphsread as follow:1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a directaccess contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspenddirect access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001,shall submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts oragreements along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  Afailure to submit this information for the Commission s consideration willbe considered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving thecontracts and agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each ofthe actual contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with theCommission s Docket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)Robert Barnett.2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who haveexecuted direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposedprotective order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, whichshall be submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3.  3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shallwork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective orderand nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commissionstaff by December 11, 2001. 4.     Parties  supplemental comments to the comments they filed in responseto the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted byJanuary 4, 2002.As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their ownnames, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM andWPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what coursethey wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fightthis Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be consideringour options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a verypreliminary analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not havejurisdiction over either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request isalso particularly outrageous because of the statements that, \"A failure tosubmit this information for the Commission s consideration will beconsidered a waiver of the arguments related to the claims involving thecontracts and agreements\" and \"Parties to this proceeding may have access tothese contracts and agreements after the appropriate protective order andnondisclosure agreements are in effect.\"  The former is a likely denial ofdue process and the latter exposes proprietary contracts and pricinginformation to ESP competitors and exposes sensitive pricing information tocompetitors of energy-dependent customers.   Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this istime for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC,SPURR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from theGovernor s Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would bevery much appreciated. Dan Law Offices of Daniel W.
